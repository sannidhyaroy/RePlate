## The Problem we Solve
Food waste is a pressing global issue, contributing significantly to environmental degradation, depletion of natural resources, and economic strain. Discarding edible food not only wastes the food itself but also the valuable water, energy, and labor invested in its production. At the household level, the improper use of available ingredients often leads to daily challenges such as budget imbalances, unnecessary wastage, and reliance on unhealthy fast food‚Äîespecially among individuals with busy lifestyles who struggle to plan meals with what's already at hand.  

As the global population continues to rise, so does the demand for food production. This makes it increasingly important for every individual to take responsibility for consuming and utilizing food efficiently.  

### Solution 
In this context, RePlate emerges as a smart solution to tackle household food waste. Through its intelligent recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, RePlate helps users make the most of what they already have. By doing so, it not only reduces food wastage but also supports better grocery planning and promotes healthier eating habits.  

    

## Features
  The current version of RePlate has these features:
  - **User Registration with Email Verification:** New users can sign up securely, with a verification process to confirm their email.
  - **Login for Returning Users:** Registered users can easily log in to access their personalized experience.
  - **Smart Recipe Search:** Users input their available leftover ingredients and receive a curated list of possible recipes tailored to what's on hand

## How to Run Locally?
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)


### Installations


1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sannidhyaroy/Ankaa.git
    cd Ankaa
    ```
2.  Install node modules:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Configure a Supabase Project:
    - From the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects), select `New Project`.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to choose your Organization, enter a Project name, a database password and your region (preferably closest to you for lower latency).
    - Keep the default Security Options and Advanced Configuration, and click on `Create Project`.
4.  Note your API details:
    - Select your Supabase Project from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects).
    - Navigate to `Project Settings` from the left toolbar menu.
    - Navigate to the `Data API` page under `Configuration` from the left sidebar.
    - Note the Project URL, it's the RESTful endpoint for querying and managing your database. You'll need this later.
      Under Project API Keys, note your anon key, you'll need this key to connect to your database later.
5.  Setup Environment Variables:
    ```bash
    cp -v .env.example .env
    ```
    - Paste the Project URL from the above step into `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`.
    - Paste your anon key from the above step into `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
    - It's recommended to lockdown file permissions of your environment file, as it contains confidential information like api keys. On a bash shell, you can use the following command:
      ```bash
      chmod 600 .env
      ```
6.  Setup PostgreSQL:
    - For detailed instructions on setting up the database, refer to the [Database README](./database/README.md).
